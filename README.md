# -JourneyMap-Tourist-Places-Info
/* The Tourist Places GUI, developed using Java, JDBC, and MySQL, offers an intuitive way to explore travel destinations. Users can seamlessly navigate through states and districts, selecting their preferred location from dropdown menus. Leveraging JDBC and MySQL, the application dynamically fetches real-time information about tourist places within the chosen district. A click on a specific destination reveals vital details such as nearest railway station, distance from nearest railway station, entry fees, and opening hours. Interactive maps provide a spatial overview, aiding in itinerary planning. User reviews and ratings contribute to a community-driven experience. The system ensures offline access, allowing users to retrieve previously accessed information without an internet connection. This GUI is a comprehensive and user-friendly tool, enriching travel exploration with efficient data retrieval and presentation. */
